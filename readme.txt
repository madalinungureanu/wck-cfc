== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I display my custom fields in the frontend? =

Let's consider we have a meta box with the following arguments:
- Meta name: books
- Post Type: post
And we also have two fields defined:
- A text custom field with the Field Title: Book name
- And another text custom field with the Field Title: Author name

You will notice that slugs will automatically be created for the two text fields. For 'Book name' the slug will be 'book-name' and for 'Author name' the slug will be 'author-name'

Let's see what the code for displaying the meta box values in single.php of your theme would be:

`<?php $books = get_post_meta( $post->ID, 'books', true ); 
foreach( $books as $book){
	echo $book['book-name'] . '<br/>';
	echo $book['author-name'] . '<br/>';
}?>`

So as you can see the Meta Name 'books' is used as the $key parameter of the function get_post_meta() and the slugs of the text fields are used as keys for the resulting array. Basically CFC stores the entries as custom fields in a multidimensional array. In our case the array would be:

`<?php array( array( "book-name" => "The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy", "author-name" => "Douglas Adams" ),  array( "book-name" => "Ender's Game", "author-name" => "Orson Scott Card" ) );?>`

This is true even for single entries.
